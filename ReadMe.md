Security Essential Practices
============================

Overview
--------

This repository contains **practical exercises**, **programming examples**, and detailed tutorials on fundamental cybersecurity concepts. The content is designed to help users develop hands-on skills in cryptography, hashing, log file analysis, regular expressions, password management, encryption, and Python scripting.

Contents
--------

### 1\. Log File Analysis

*   Analyze log files using **Python**.
    
*   Extract IP addresses, URLs, email addresses, and error codes using regex.
    

### 2\. Cryptography with Python

*   Perform **symmetric encryption and decryption** using Pythonâ€™s cryptography library.
    
*   Generate and manage encryption keys securely.
    
*   Convert hashes and data between different encoding formats (e.g., Hex, Base64).
    

### 3\. Hashing and Password Security

*   Compute hashes (SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, MD5) using Python's hashlib.
    
*   Implement **salted password hashing**.
    
*   Crack hashed passwords by brute force to demonstrate vulnerabilities.
    

### 4\. Password and PIN Encryption/Decryption

*   Encrypt and decrypt sensitive data using user-provided PINs.
    
*   Create robust PIN validation scripts.
    

### 5\. Regular Expressions (regex)

*   Extract detailed information from complex log and text files.
    
*   Develop and test regex patterns using Python and online regex testers.
    

### 6\. Password Cracking and Permutation Generation

*   Generate permutations of strings for security testing.
    
*   Measure brute-force password cracking performance.
    

Programming Languages & Tools Used
----------------------------------

*   **Python:** Primary scripting language.
    
*   **Cryptography Library:** Encryption and decryption.
